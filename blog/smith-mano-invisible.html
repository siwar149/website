		<h3>Two misinterpretations of the "invisible hand" metaphor</h3>
		
		<p>On the one hand, Milton Friedman, one of the most notorious speakers of 20th century 
		monetarism, noted, in an interview, that:</p>
		<blockquote>The invisible hand is a phrase that was introduced by Adam Smith, in his great book
			The Wealth of Nations, which dealt with the way in which individuals who only sought 
			their own interest were guided by an invisible hand to promote the public welfare, which 
			it was not part of his intention. He was talking about the economic market, where people 
			buy and sell, and he pointed out that, in order for the butcher or baker to make an income 
			they had to produce something that someone wanted to buy. In this way, the individual, by 
			following his own interest, serves the interest of the consumer.
		</blockquote>

		<p>On the other hand, Paul Samuelson interpreted this phrase as if he were trying to justify the 
		concept of perfect competition of the free market, making an analogy with the neoclassical concept 
		of general equilibrium, and offered his own criticisms of this metaphor of the invisible hand 
		(Cue Mancera , 2003). In this sense, Samuelson's work being so influential in the modern study of 
		economics, it is not surprising that this error has become widespread.</p>

		<h3>Logos as a principle and God</h3>

		<blockquote>
			In the beginning there was the <i>Logos</i>, and the <i>Logos</i> was with God, and the
			<i>Logos</i> was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him,
			and without Him nothing that was made was made. In him was life, and the life was the 
			light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not understand it 
			(John's gospel, ch. 1).
		</blockquote>

		<p>The English translation of these verses does not say <i>Logos</i> but Verb or Word. However, 
		in the oldest writings, in the Latin and Greek languages, the word used is <i>Logos</i>. It is important
		to understand the concept of <i>Logos</i>, especially that used by the Stoics, to understand, perhaps, 
		the true intention of Adam Smith when he used the concept of "invisible hand" in both <i>Theory of 
		moral sentiments</i> (TMS) and <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> (WN), since there are reasons to believe
		that Smith was influenced by the 18th century Christian Stoicism that was in vogue, in those years,
		in Scotland.</p>

		<p>Stoicism arises in the third century BC and thanks to a bankrupt merchant named Zeno of Citio
		(Zeno of Citium). His ship having sunk off the shores of Athens, Zeno approached philosophy through
		Socratic writings (Jones, 2010). The name of the philosophical school that he founded comes from
		the porch (stoa) of the agora, which was where he met with his followers. Zeno taught that everything,
		from the fall of a leaf to the expansion of an empire, was governed by an underlying principle:
		the Logos (Jones, 2010); Aristotle attributed to it the meaning of "justice"; it was also 
		translated as "reason." In historical records, it is also appreciated that the Stoics adduced 
		Logos the meaning of "God", "providence", "fortune" and "faith" (Jones, 2010).</p>

		<p>In Smith's words, at the heart of Stoic teachings is the conviction that “even the smallest 
		parts of the universe fit together perfectly, and all contribute to an interconnected system” 
		(as cited in Jones, 2010). According to Chrysippus, all things are just parts of a whole whose 
		body is nature and God is the soul (Copleston, 1963, I, ii, 132). The purpose of life proposed by
		the Stoics was "peace of mind in the evident conformity of one's actions with the laws of reason 
		(Logos, Providence) and in the face of the vicissitudes of destiny that one cannot control" 
		(Marcus Aurelius , p. 57). Smith, under the influence of his professor Hutcheson, believed that 
		“society can be better organized through the practical application of reason and not only can, 
		but must do so” (Del Hierro, 2019).</p>

		<p>The Stoics rejected the Persian idea that suffering was inflicted on humanity by an 
		independent evil power (Arnold, 1911). Instead, they adopted the Socratic view of the problem as
		a result of the efforts of the person who does not fully understand what is good (ignorance),
		and they described sin as a matter of "wandering the way" (Jones, 2010, p. 3 ). We see that Stoic
		thinking reflects many of the ideas that Adam Smith pours into TMS and WN, such as that individual
		ignorance (about others, about oneself, etc.) represents an evil in society (Smith, 1759; 
		Smith , 1776).</p>

		<p>In this sense, a certain significant influence of the ideas of Marcus Aurelius is glimpsed in
		the thought of Adam Smith, considering, in addition, that his professor Hutcheson published an 
		English translation of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations in 1742 (Jones, 2010). From all that has been
		said, it can be partially concluded that a good interpretation of the metaphor of the invisible 
		hand finds support in the concept of Logos, which is the ordering principle of everything.</p>
