                <header><h1>History of economic thought</h1></header>
           <section class="main">
		<p>The economy, from the Greek <i>oikonomia</i>, which refers to the "government of the house",
		was most probably thought since the emergence of the first cities, such as Mesopotamia 
		and others. However, only those ideas of authors who left written records on their 
		formulations about economics can be reviewed with some precision.
                </p>

		<h3>Xenophon (430-354 b.C.)</h3>

		<p>Philosopher, military man and historian. The main ideas that Xenophon raised about economics 
		deal with what is considered a good, the value of goods, the direction of any company, the 
		division of labor, the influence of supply and demand on the price level and mining royalties. 
		</p>

		<p><i>What is considered a good?</i>A good is everything from which a benefit can be obtained, 
		therefore something that harms is not a good. That <i>something</i> can be material objects, people,
		situations, etc. 
		</p>

		<p><i>The value of goods</i>: A good has value if the person who owns it knows how to use it and it
		is useful in carrying out a task, for example, a flute is used to make music for those who know how 
		to play it (use value). But if the person in question does not know how to use the good, she could 
		always sell it and get money in exchange for it. However, if the money is not used to acquire 
		another asset that is useful, the sale could not be considered a profit. 
		</p>

		<p> This author also mentions that any company will always be better managed by its owner:<i>In the 
		master's eye, the horse fattens</i>. About the division of labor Xenophon is going to say something
		very similar to what Adam Smith is going to postulate about the limitations of this division due to
		the size of the market. He says that the division and excellence of labor is greater in large-scale
		productive units; the productive units grow in scale the larger the village in which they are 
		located. Regarding the supply and demand of a good, he mentions that when the supply increases but
		the demand remains constant, the price of the good tends to decrease. However, he mentions that 
		this is not necessarily true of the money-commodity that was already circulating in Greece at that time.
		</p>

		<p>Finally, the author advocates an equitable distribution of royalties from mining activity, and any
		extractive activity in general, since the existence of mineral in certain regions and not in others 
		is a matter of arbitrary natural endowment.
